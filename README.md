# Design Pattern in FreeCol
Project/last lab in the course TDDB84 - Design Patterns. The design pattern Prototype was implemented in the open-source game FreeCol.

The importance of good quality of a product grows rapidly these days. Especially maintenance of a system is of high concern since 
the code bases are becoming bigger and bigger and therefore harder to maintain. To be able to keep a good quality, design patterns 
are often used. In this project the effect of the Prototype design pattern has been studied using QMOOD metrics given by Bansiya and 
Davis. The quality attributes that was considered were understandability and extendibility. A case study of the the game FreeCol
was made where changes in a few of the classes of the code were implemented. Design properties were measured using metrics both 
before and after the completion of the changes. The results were positive with an approximately increase of 50% for both the 
understandability and the extendibility of the code.
